**3D Car Racing Game** 

*Description*
For my racing game workshop assignment, I decided to make it as creative as possible. I was inspired by the iconic Pixar movie that we all probably have watched in our childhood, "Cars". 
I didn't want my game to be an extremely competitive racing game even though there is one other car aside from the main player's, but I wanted it to be more of a relaxing drive for the player. 

I decided to recreate my car racing game with the Cars movie by including the famous cars logo from the movie in the middle of a canyon terrain and also including the same color palette and texture as the main character in the Cars movie series.

I also wanted to make my terrain more creative and unique, so I decided to another model of a T-Rex to make the environment look more interesting.
