**First Person Shooter**
===================

Description 
----------
For my first-person shooter game assignment, I utilized sci-fi buildings downloaded as the foundation for the game environment. To enhance the visual appeal, I added terrain, a skybox and I used several packages from the Unity asset store to decorate the scene to bring it to life.

Players control their character's movement using the keyboard's arrow keys, and they can jump by pressing the spacebar. The left mouse button is used to shoot, adding an element of combat to the game.
